    "# A Survey of Language Model Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Last Time\n",
    "In the [final notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jamesdellinger/fastai_deep_learning_course_part2_v3/blob/master/11a_transfer_learning_my_reimplementation.ipynb?flush_cache=true) that focuses on computer vision applications, we showed how to implement from scratch all the pieces required to make transfer learning work. Specifically, we demonstrated how to pre-train an XResNet34 image classifier on a large imageset ([Imagewoof](https://github.com/fastai/imagenette)), and then slice off this model's head in order to obtain a bottleneck network. We then attached this bottleneck to a custom head that was tailor-made to classify the 37 categories of dog/cat breed images in the [Oxford-IIIT Pets dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/). \n",
    "\n",
    "Along the way, we pointed out the most important pitfall to avoid when performing transfer learning: means and standard deviations in the bottleneck's pre-trained batchnorm layers should *never* be re-used when fine-tuning on a new dataset. Failure to heed this advice will significanty extend training time, and undo the time-saving benefit of transfer learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, I found that using the pre-trained XResNet34 bottleneck with a custom head enabled me to train a classifier that achieved more than 80% validation accuracy on the Pets dataset after *only 8 epochs* of training. This turned out to be far, far superior to my attempt to train an XResNet34 model on the Pets dataset from scratch. After 5 epochs that model had only reached 25% validation accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Language Models\n",
    "This will be the final PyTorch notebook in version 3 of the part II fast.ai course. We finally take a long-overdue respite from imagesets and turn our focus toward language models! We undertake a four part summary of tools for understanding text data that will introduce:\n",
    "1. Techniques for pre-processing and batching text datasets.\n",
    "2. Understanding and implementing [Stephen Merity's AWD-LSTM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02182), which takes regular LSTM language models and turbo-charges them with a wide assortment of regularization techniques.\n",
    "3. Pre-training a language model on Wikitext103.\n",
    "4. Implementing [Jeremy Howard and Sebastian Ruder's ULMFiT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146) from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "The working examples we create while exploring the ins and outs of deep learning text applications will all build toward the final goal of making a ULMFiT model that exhibits amazing performance when classifying IMDB movie reviews as either \"positive\" or \"negative.\" The diagram below outlines the process necessary to make this goal a reality:\n",

I am yet to come across one original script that David Dhawan has worked on. This one was a complete bit y bit rip off Hitch. I have nothing against remakes as such, but this one is just so lousy that it makes you even hate the original one (which was pretty decent). I fail to understand what actors like Salman and Govinda saw in this script. I read somewhere, that this was supposed to be Govinda's comeback vehicle. If thats true, then only God can save his career. Salman just overacted to the hilt. Govinda who I think is an actor of very high caliber was completely wasted. Katrina Kaif and LAra Dutta had nothing to do apart form wearing designer clothes and smiling for no rhyme or reason. Please stay away form this one!\""

    "#### Tokenization\n",
    "The first preprocessing step for our text data is to tokenize it. All this does is take the text of each individual movie review and transform it into a list that contains the review's words, in the same order in which they appear in the original review. During this process we will also create tokens that represent certain punctuation, or syntax situations that commonly occur in English sentences. \n",
    "\n",
    "The [spaCy library](https://spacy.io/) has most of the tokenization rules we'll want to apply to our text dataset already built in to it. However, there are a few more customized rules that we'll first want to specify.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we will place the tokens `xxbos` and `xxeos` (beginning/end of stream)at the beginning and end of each moview review. Their purpose is to tell the language model to reset its state. In other words, to let the model know that the subject matter/topic of the previous text document as ended, and everything that will soon follow will be related to different subject matter, such as a movie review for a different movie. Additionally, the token `xxup` is inserted before any word whose characters all appear in uppercase. Such a word's characters will then be converted to lowercase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why add in these custom tokenization rules at all? Why not just leave uppercase characters as uppercase? In practice we've found that including more aggressive tokenization rules ultimately leads to language models that are able to more accurately classify the sentiment of a block of text, and able to generate more natural, \"believable\" text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that before we go in and apply tokenization to our text data, we'll first need to clean up some html code and other messy characters that tend to make their way into text datasets, such as our IMDB Large Movie Reviews, that have been scraped from internet sites. We'll need to clean up any snippets of raw html code or html renderings of characters, which were not originally part of the movie review texts. Examples include the \"$\" character being displayed as \"#36;\" as well as the html code for a line break, `<br />`.\n",

    "Why would we prefer to replace repeating characters or words with \"counter\" tokens? Most often, there isn't any significance in a word or character being repeated 4 times versus being repeated, say, 5 times. What is, instead, significant is a word or character being repeated just a handful of times, versus being repeated a very large number, say 28, times. Using counter-style tokens will make it easier for our language model to learn that the *magnitude* by which a certain character or word is repeated, is what most strongly influences meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, what if we were to instead create a unique token every time the same character, such as an exclamation point, is repeated at a new length? E.g. we would have one token to represent 27 exclamation points, another token to represent 28 exclamations, and another to represent 3, and so on and so forth. In this case, even if the corpus contains many examples of exclamation points being repeated successive times, unless repeated exclamation points occur in each of the above sequence lengths often enough, it is unlikely that our model will learn the truth about exclamation points: a lot of them at once add a lot of emphasis.\n",
    "\n",
    "More likely, our model might incorrectly learn that 28 exclamation points in a row adds emphasis, but that 27 exclamation points in a row has no special meaning at all!\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, we could create an individual token for each exclamation point. While this would conceivable make it easier for our LSTM model to learn that many exclamation points = big emphasis, it will at the same time require the model to have to maintain quite a long memory of previous states (28 steps previous) in order to learn what it needs to learn about long sequences of exclamation points. Capturing all this information in one single token makes it much easier for our model to learn!\n",

    "My initial implementation of this class did not strictly ensure that the numericalized vocabulary would be no longer than the value passed to the class' `max_vocab` argument. This oversight became a problem because tokenizing and numericalizing the WikiText 103 text corpus produced a vocabulary of length `60,001`, while my first attempts to do the same for the IMDB movie reviews happend to produce a vocab that had `60,002` words. It would turn out that in order to pre-train a language model on WikiText 103 and then fine-tune using the IMDB movie reviews corpus, I would need to ensure that both textsets had vocab lists that were identical in length.\n",
    "\n",
    "What happened was that after a `NumericalizeProcessor()` object creates its vocab list, the following logic was used to ensure that all of the default special tokens, such as `PAD`, `UNK`, etc., were placed at the beginning of the vocab:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "for o in reversed(default_special_tokens):\n",
    "    if o in self.vocab: self.vocab.remove(o)\n",
    "    self.vocab.insert(0, o)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What this logic didn't take into account was cases when there would be some tokens in `default_special_tokens` that didn't otherwise appear in the vocab for the corpus that was generated inside a `NumericalizeProcessor()` object. For example, we would never expect the padding token to already be inside a tokenized vocabulary. However, we nonetheless need it inside our vocabulary because it will absolutely be part of text sampled fed as inputs to our model should we ever desire to perform classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, even if other default special tokens aren't originally part of our vocabulary, we still ultimately need to have them inside it. Why? Well, say that our original training and validation text sets don't contain a single occurrence of the `UNK` token. After training our model, if we perform inference on some new text that has some strange html artifacts such as `'<unk>'`, we will need to replace those occurrences with the `UNK` token. But if our model doesn't have a vocabulary embedding for this token, we won't be able to perform this relacement, and it's possible that our model's ability to perform inference would be diminished.\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Batching for Language Model Training\n",
    "If you're used to training image classifier models, batching for language model training can seem a bit counterintuitive at first. One thing we *don't* want in this scenario is to feed our model batches of discrete IMDB reviews. Rather, seeing as how we want our model to simply learn the *language* that's used to compose IMDB reviews, there's no need to break out each individual review; we can just concatenate all the review texts together and feed this *stream* into our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish this, we'll create a special langauge model dataset to shuffle (if we want) and then concatenate the movie reviews into one big list of tokens. The dataset then divides this long list into into `batch_size` number of equal length chunks. \n",
    "\n",
    "These per-batch chunks will be further subdivided into even smaller sequences that are processed in parallel by our model during training. The length of these smaller sequences is the number of words each mini-batch of our model will be responsible for looking at during any single training iteration. We get to choose how many words we want this to be, though 70 is a nice standard. Our model will attempt to learn how to predict the most appropriate word that should follow each of the (70, for example) individual words that are inside each these smaller sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, these small sequences are essentially the individual training inputs that our model will train on in order to learn how to understand and generate language. The length we choose for these small sequences is the distance that an LSTM model will \"backpropagate through time\" (often shortened to `bptt`) in order to learn how to predict the subsequent word that should follow each word in a given input word sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an illustration of how the whole batching process for training language models works. Say we have the following stream of text concatenated together by our language model dataset:"

    "This demonstrates that the dataloader's final iteration is indeed `iteration1`, which is the second of the two iterations of batches that our dataloader returns. In our first crack at this toy example using Pandas above, we were able to generate three iterations of six batches that each had five-word sequences. Why doesn't our dataloader do that for us here?\n",

    "The target for each word in the input sequence is the word that originally followed it in the text. We have to ensure that we batch our dataset in such a way that each word that goes into our model as training inputs will have one word in the corpus that directly follows it. This means that there will always be at least one word in our training set that serves as a target alone, and doesn't get trained on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that we have a sample corpus containing 91 tokens with a batch size of 6 and a bptt length of 5. Dividing 91 by 6 gives 15 with a remainder of 1. Why can't we have a sequence of 15 for each of the 6 batches? (Indeed, doing so would have us training over 3 iterations.) Well, if we did this, once we got to the epoch's third and final iteration, only the last word in the bptt sequence of batch0 would have a target to predict (remember, dividing 91 by 6 has a remainder of *only* 1). There would be no targets for the final word of the final iteration for the other five batches.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this thought exercise we can see that the actual per-batch sequence length will be long enough so that we can train the maximum number of iterations (fit as many bptt sequences as possible into each batch's sequence of words), while still ensuring that there will be at least one word left over to serve as the final prediction target word for each batch at the end of the final iteration.\n",

Therefore, each of the 50 mini-batches that came from the end of one of the 50 original megabatches will have text documents that are shorter than those of the other mini-batches that didn't come from the end of a megabatch. Grabbing the final batch from the list of all the batches is just a quick way to know for sure that we're grabbing one of these 50 mini-batches that did come from the end of a megabatch. \n",

    "#### Text Document Padding\n",
    "We're almost home free. But there's one extra very important detail we can't overlook. Recall that during a training iteration, some of the mini-batches returned by our `SortishSampler` will contain longer text documents than some of the other mini-batches. Recall also that we place the longest batch first, one of the 50 shorter batches last, and shuffle all the other batches in the middle. The thing is, when we actually train our model, we can't train in parallel using some batches that contain a text document with less tokens/words than those contained by the other batches. The GPU expects each batch to have identically sized inputs to pass through our model's layers at every iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "To workaround this limitation, we can place padding tokens at the end of each shorter batch's text sequence. This will have the effect of making the text sequences of all other mini-batches as long as the text sequence of the batch that has the longest document. And thanks to this, at every iteration each batch will receive inputs that are of an identical length. Note that from iteration to iteration, the length of these inputs will gradually diminish, owing to the way we wrote `SortishSampler`. "

To understand how to implement all these regularization techniques, and to get an idea of why Smerity includes them, we should first understand how LSTM cells work and what purposes they serve.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### LSTM Cells\n",
    "In the final lesson of the fast.ai part I course we convered RNNs and [spent some time implementing](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jamesdellinger/fastai_deep_learning_course_part1_v3/blob/master/lesson7-human-numbers-my-reimplementation.ipynb?flush_cache=true) an RNN that used 2-layer GRU cells to record and remember states. LSTM (long-short term memory) cells are quite similar and perform the same function: they enable a recurrent neural network to maintain an ability to store and recall important patterns, even if these patterns reoccur in the dataset somewhat infrequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "LSTMs are deep neural networks in and of themselves. These networks contain layers with weights that can be trained, and the network ultimately learns to distinguish between the information that it should remember for the long term (across timesteps), and what information is likely not representative of an important pattern and can thus be discarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "![LSTM Layers](images/LSTM3-chain.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, each LSTM cell contains four small single-hidden-layer neural networks, also called \"gates.\" An LSTM cell has inputs that come from three sources: the state of the same LSTM cell at the previous timestep, the hidden state of the network layers directly preceding the LSTM cell at the current timestep, as well as the hidden state of the same network layers from the previous timestep. Note that these hidden states could come from the kind of fully connected layer you'd typically encounter inside an RNN, or could be the output of an LSTM cell that's directly underneath the current LSTM cell. Sometimes we stack multiple LSTM cells one right on top of the other, in the same way that we might stack multiple fully-connected layers inside an RNN. Each gate in an LSTM cell is responsible for one of the following four tasks:\n",
    "1. **Forget Gate**: Deciding what information contained in both of the LSTM cell's network hidden state input sources (from the current and previous timesteps) should be *left out* from the cell's current state:\n",
    "![Forget Gate](images/LSTM3-focus-f.png)\n",
    "2. **Input Gate**: Deciding what information from both of the cell's network layer hidden state inputs will be *updated* and then added into the cell's current state:\n",
    "3. **Save Gate**: Deciding what *brand new* information, coming from both network hidden state inputs, should added in to the LSTM cell's current state:\n",
    "![Input and Save Gate](images/LSTM3-focus-i.png)\n",
    "![Adding to Cell State](images/LSTM3-focus-C.png)\n",
    "4. **Output Gate**: Once more filtering both of the LSTM cell's incoming network hidden state input sources to decide what information should be sent directly as inputs to the LSTM cell at the next timestep. This output will become the \"previous timestep network input\" at the LSTM cell at the next timestep:\n",
    "![Output Gate](images/LSTM3-focus-o.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The five diagrams above all come from Chris Olah's wonderful post, [*Understanding LSTM Networks*](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/).\n",

    "#### Writing a Home-grown LSTM Implementation\n",
    "Right now we're gonna implement our own versions of LSTM cells and then LSTM network layers from scratch. Since all gates process the same duo of hidden layer inputs from current/previous timestep, we can architect the LSTM cell in such a way that these inputs are concatenated and passed through all three gates that have sigmoid activations, at the same time!\n",

    "#### Dropout\n",
    "As mentioned earlier, the *WD* in AWD-LSTM stands for \"weight dropped\" and using dropout is indeed a core part of the AWD-LSTM model. In fact, dropout is applied to various parts of an AWD-LSTM network, and we're going to implement each of these dropout flavors right now!\n",
    "\n",
    "The dropout regularization technique is nothing more than replacing some proportion of a layer's weight coefficients with zeros. We choose a probability `p` that also indicates the fraction of layer weights we wish to change to zero. And on each forward pass, we replace each weight in the layer with a zero with a probability of `p`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that changing some proportion of the layer weights to zero would inevitably cause the expected value, or average of the model's activation outputs to change. Note, also, that during inference dropout is *not* applied. This means that the distribution of activation outputs from which loss is computed during training, would never be close in value to the range of activation outputs that will be observed when test samples are run through the model's layers at inference time. \n",
    "\n",
    "The long and the short of it is that if we don't compensate for this disparity, there will be no way we could train a model with dropout and then use that same model to perform inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thankfully, there is a way to ensure that we can use our model's trained layer weights as-is at inference time, and still drop-out some of the layer weights during training. On each forward pass we'll apply a correction of `1/(1-p)` to all layer weights that don't get dropped-out to zero. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we chose `1/(1-p)` as the scaling factor for the layer weights that do remain? The goal is to have the expected value of activation outputs remain the same, regardless of whether the model is in training or inference mode. If each layer weight will become 0 with a probability of `p`, this means that the layer weights that remain each do so with a probability of `1-p`. One approach to ensuring that the expected value of activation outputs at inference remains consistent with what's seen at training is to multiply those layer weights that didn't get dropped out during training by `(1-p)` at at test time. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, such an approach would require us to have a separate, slightly modified version of our model that we use only at test time. If, instead, we divided the non-dropped-out layer weights by `(1-p)` while training, this would the same effect (keeping expected value of activation outputs consistent across training and inference) as multiplying those same weights by `(1-p)` at inference, all without the necessity of using two different architectures for training and inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement dropout we can create a simple mask, of same size and shape as the most recent network weight layer, that indicates the actual locations of the weights to be dropped, and then apply this mask to the layer's weights:"

And it doesn't matter which of the three dimensions we choose to broadcast onto.

    "The third and final form of dropout we'll add to our AWD-LSTM model will be to drop-out some of the weights from the word embedding matrix. But first, what on earth is a word embedding matrix?\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall earlier that when we preprocessed our IMDB corpus for both the language model and document classifier model, we converted the vocabulary found in all the texts first to tokens, and then to integer values, where each unique token in the dataset's complete vocabulary had a corresponding unique integer value. \n",
    "\n",
    "While we could move ahead and train either a language or classifier model using just these integer values as the model inputs, there's another approach that will allow our model to learn and store a much richer representation of each token's meaning. We can create a vector for each word in the corpus' vocabulary. These vectors will have the same pre-determined number of weights, and these weights will *also* be learned by the model during training. Over several timesteps, our model will not only learn values for the weights of its RNN and LSTM layers, but it will also learn values to compose a rich and nuanced represenation of each word in the vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "By this point, it shouldn't surprise us that Smerity found that adding dropout to word embedding layers also improved the AWD-LSTM model's performance. Note that embedding dropout works a bit differently than what we've seen thusfar: we apply dropout to *entire* vectors!"

Our language model's predictions will always be for the next most likely word. That means prediction outputs will need to be the same size as the model's vocab, and the \"next most likely\" word will be chosen by running the final linear layer's output vector through a log softmax function. Consequently, the final linear layer will also need have a number of outputs that matches the length of the corpus' vocabulary. Initializing the final, fully connected layer with the same embeddings that the AWD-LSTM base model has already learned will give our decoder that much more \"knowledge\" about the words it is predicting. This head start means that the decoder will require much less training iterations to get to the point where it is able to output compelling predictions (or generate believable text snippets)."

    "## 3. Pretraining a language model on the WikiText 103 corpus\n",
    "[WikiText 103](http://academictorrents.com/details/a4fee5547056c845e31ab952598f43b42333183c) was [introduced](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07843) by Merity, Xiong, et. al. in 2016. It is a collection of over 100 million tokens that were extracted from a set of \"verified Good and Featured\" Wikipedia articles written in the English language. WikiText 103 covers an unimaginably wide range of topics and is thus the intuitive go-to choice to serve as the to use in training a language model to have the broadest possible understanding of the English language. By comparison, the IMDB movie reviews corpus' vocabulary obviously spans a much narrower subject matter than WikiText 103.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a quick step back and first think about why we're even bothering with training language models if our real goal at the end of this notebook is to build a world class IMDB movie review *classifier*. The idea is that before we train a model to distinguish between a \"positive\" movie review and a \"negative\" movie review, it should first learn how to understand the actual language in which the movie reviews are written.\n",
    "\n",
    "And although we just successfully trained a language model using the IMDB reviews corpus, we can do much better to set up our text classifier for eventual success. Rather than teaching our model about \"movie review\" English, let's first give it a robust grounding in English, \"in general.\" Afterwards, we can fine tune this language model using the movie reviews corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is reminiscent of computer vision transfer learning, where the bottleneck layers of a model that will eventually be used as an image classifier or object detector are pre-trained on ImageNet. Indeed, in the same way that ImageNet pre-training saves time (especially if you can use someone else's pre-trained weights) and ultimately improves the model's ability to perform its task, language model pre-training/transfer learning also drastically improves performance. It also gives us the option of using someone else's pretrained weights, assuming that we're using the same model architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we'll do the pre-training ourselves, so we can learn how to work with the WikiText 103 corpus."

With victory in battle , experience points are awarded to the squad , which are distributed into five different attributes shared by the entire squad , a feature differing from early games \\' method of distributing to different unit types . \\n \\n = = Plot = = \\n \\n The game takes place during the Second Europan War . Gallian Army Squad 422 , also known as \" The Nameless \" , are a penal military unit composed of criminals , foreign deserters , and military offenders whose real names are erased from the records and thereon officially referred to by numbers . Ordered by the Gallian military to perform the most dangerous missions that the Regular Army and Militia will not do , they are nevertheless up to the task , exemplified by their motto , xxunk xxunk , meaning \" Always Ready . \" The three main characters are No.7 Kurt Irving , an army officer falsely accused of treason who wishes to redeem himself ; Ace No.1 Imca , a female Darcsen heavy weapons specialist who seeks revenge against the Valkyria who destroyed her home ; and No.13 Riela xxunk , a seemingly jinxed young woman who is unknowingly a descendant of the Valkyria . Together with their fellow squad members , these three are tasked to fight against a mysterious Imperial unit known as Calamity Raven , consisting of mostly Darcsen soldiers . \\n As the Nameless officially do not exist , the upper echelons of the Gallian Army exploit the concept of plausible deniability in order to send them on missions that would otherwise make Gallia lose face in the war . While at times this works to their advantage , such as a successful incursion into Imperial territory , other orders cause certain members of the 422nd great distress . One such member , xxunk , becomes so enraged that he abandons his post and defects into the ranks of Calamity Raven , attached to the ideal of Darcsen independence proposed by their leader , Dahau . At the same time , elements within Gallian Army Command move to erase the Nameless in order to protect their own interests . Hounded by both allies and enemies , and combined with the presence of a traitor within their ranks , the 422nd desperately move to keep themselves alive while at the same time fight to help the Gallian war effort . This continues until the Nameless \\'s commanding officer , Ramsey Crowe , who had been kept under house arrest , is escorted to the capital city of xxunk in order to present evidence exonerating the weary soldiers and expose the real traitor , the Gallian General that had accused Kurt of Treason . \\n Partly due to these events , and partly due to the major losses in manpower Gallia suffers towards the end of the war with the Empire , the Nameless are offered a formal position as a squad in the Gallian Army rather than serve as an anonymous shadow force . This is short @-@ lived , however , as following Maximilian \\'s defeat , Dahau and Calamity Raven move to activate an ancient xxunk super weapon within the Empire , kept secret by their benefactor . Without the support of Maximilian or the chance to prove themselves in the war with Gallia , it is Dahau \\'s last trump card in creating a new Darcsen nation . As an armed Gallian force invading the Empire just following the two nations \\' cease @-@ fire would certainly wreck their newfound peace , Kurt decides to once again make his squad the Nameless , asking Crowe to list himself and all under his command as killed @-@ in @-@ action . Now owing allegiance to none other than themselves , the 422nd confronts Dahau and destroys the xxunk weapon . Each member then goes their separate ways in order to begin their lives anew . \\n \\n = = Development = = \\n \\n Concept work for Valkyria Chronicles III began after development finished on Valkyria Chronicles II in early 2010 , with full development beginning shortly after this . The director of Valkyria Chronicles II , Takeshi Ozawa , returned to that role for Valkyria Chronicles III . Development work took approximately one year . After the release of Valkyria Chronicles II , the staff took a look at both the popular response for the game and what they wanted to do next for the series . Like its predecessor , Valkyria Chronicles III was developed for PlayStation Portable : this was due to the team wanting to refine the mechanics created for Valkyria Chronicles II , and they had not come up with the \" revolutionary \" idea that would warrant a new entry for the PlayStation 3 . Speaking in an interview , it was stated that the development team considered Valkyria Chronicles III to be the series \\' first true sequel : while Valkyria Chronicles II had required a large amount of trial and error during development due to the platform move , the third game gave them a chance to improve upon the best parts of Valkyria Chronicles II due to being on the same platform . In addition to Sega staff from the previous games , development work was also handled by xxunk The original scenario was written Kazuki Yamanobe , while the script was written by Hiroyuki Fujii , Koichi Majima , xxunk Miyagi , Seiki xxunk and Takayuki xxunk . Its story was darker and more somber than that of its predecessor . \\n The majority of material created for previous games , such as the xxunk system and the design of maps , was carried over . Alongside this , improvements were made to the game \\'s graphics and some elements were expanded , such as map layouts , mission structure , and the number of playable units per mission . A part of this upgrade involved creating unique polygon models for each character \\'s body . In order to achieve this , the cooperative elements incorporated into the second game were removed , as they took up a large portion of memory space needed for the improvements . They also adjusted the difficulty settings and ease of play so they could appeal to new players while retaining the essential components of the series \\' gameplay . The newer systems were decided upon early in development . The character designs were done by xxunk Honjou , who had worked on the previous Valkyria Chronicles games . When creating the Nameless Squad , Honjou was faced with the same problem he had had during the first game : the military uniforms essentially destroyed character individuality , despite him needing to create unique characters the player could identify while maintaining a sense of reality within the Valkyria Chronicles world . The main color of the Nameless was black . As with the previous Valkyria games , Valkyria Chronicles III used the xxunk graphics engine . The anime opening was produced by Production I.G. \\n \\n = = = Music = = = \\n \\n The music was composed by Hitoshi Sakimoto , who had also worked on the previous Valkyria Chronicles games . When he originally heard about the project , he thought it would be a light tone similar to other Valkyria Chronicles games , but found the themes much darker than expected . An early theme he designed around his original vision of the project was rejected . He xxunk the main theme about seven times through the music production due to this need to reassess the game . The main theme was initially recorded using orchestra , then Sakimoto removed elements such as the guitar and bass , then adjusted the theme using a synthesizer before redoing segments such as the guitar piece on their own before incorporating them into the theme . The rejected main theme was used as a hopeful tune that played during the game \\'s ending . The battle themes were designed around the concept of a \" modern battle \" divorced from a fantasy scenario by using modern musical instruments , constructed to create a sense of atonality . While Sakimoto was most used to working with synthesized music , he felt that he needed to incorporate live instruments such as orchestra and guitar . The guitar was played by Mitsuhiro Ohta , who also arranged several of the later tracks . The game \\'s opening theme song , \" If You Wish for ... \" ( xxunk , xxunk Kimi ga xxunk Nara ) , was sung by Japanese singer May \\'n . Its theme was the reason soldiers fought , in particular their wish to protect what was precious to them rather than a sense of responsibility or duty . Its lyrics were written by Seiko Fujibayashi , who had worked on May \\'n on previous singles . \\n \\n = = = Release = = = \\n \\n In September 2010 , a teaser website was revealed by Sega , hinting at a new Valkyria Chronicles game . In its September issue , Famitsu listed that Senjō no Valkyria 3 would be arriving on the PlayStation Portable . Its first public appearance was at the 2010 Tokyo Game Show ( TGS ) , where a demo was made available for journalists and attendees . During the publicity , story details were kept scant so as not to spoil too much for potential players , along with some of its content still being in flux at the time of its reveal . To promote the game and detail the story leading into the game \\'s events , an episodic Flash visual novel written by Fujii began release in January 2011 . The game was released January 27 , 2011 . During an interview , the development team said that the game had the capacity for downloadable content ( DLC ) , but that no plans were finalized . Multiple DLC maps , featuring additional missions and recruitable characters , were released between February and April 2011 . An expanded edition of the game , Valkyria Chronicles III Extra Edition , released on November 23 , 2011 . Packaged and sold at a lower price than the original , Extra Edition game with seven additional episodes : three new , three chosen by staff from the game \\'s DLC , and one made available as a pre @-@ order bonus . People who also owned the original game could transfer their save data between versions . \\n Unlike its two predecessors , Valkyria Chronicles III was not released in the west . According to Sega , this was due to poor sales of Valkyria Chronicles II and the general unpopularity of the PSP in the west . An unofficial fan translation patch began development in February 2012 : players with a copy of Valkyria Chronicles III could download and apply the patch , which translated the game \\'s text into English . Compatible with the Extra Edition , the patch was released in January 2014 . \\n \\n = = Reception = = \\n \\n On its day of release in Japan , Valkyria Chronicles III topped both platform @-@ exclusive and multi @-@ platform sales charts . By early February , the game sold 102 @,@ 779 units , coming in second overall to The Last Story for the Wii . By the end of the year , the game had sold just over 152 @,@ 500 units . \\n Famitsu enjoyed the story , and were particularly pleased with the improvements to gameplay . Japanese gaming site Game Watch Impress , despite negatively noting its pacing and elements recycled from previous games , was generally positive about its story and characters , and found its gameplay entertaining despite off @-@ putting difficulty spikes . 4Gamer.net writer Naohiko xxunk , in a \" Play Test \" article based on the game \\'s PSN demo , felt that Valkyria Chronicles III provided a \" profound feeling of closure \" for the Valkyria Chronicles series . He praised its gameplay despite annoying limitations to aspects such as special abilities , and positively noted its shift in story to a tone similar to the first game . \\n PlayStation Official Magazine - UK praised the story \\'s blurring of Gallia \\'s moral standing , art style , and most points about its gameplay , positively noting the latter for both its continued quality and the tweaks to balance and content . Its one major criticism were multiple difficulty spikes , something that had affected the previous games . Heath Hindman of gaming website PlayStation Lifestyle praised the addition of non @-@ linear elements and improvements or removal of mechanics from Valkyria Chronicles II in addition to praising the returning gameplay style of previous games . He also positively noted the story \\'s serious tone . Points criticized in the review were recycled elements , awkward cutscenes that seemed to include all characters in a scene for no good reason , pacing issues , and occasional problems with the game \\'s AI . \\n In a preview of the TGS demo , Ryan Geddes of IGN was left excited as to where the game would go after completing the demo , along with enjoying the improved visuals over Valkyria Chronicles II . Kotaku \\'s Richard Eisenbeis was highly positive about the game , citing is story as a return to form after Valkyria Chronicles II and its gameplay being the best in the series . His main criticisms were its length and gameplay repetition , along with expressing regret that it would not be localized . \\n \\n = = Legacy = = \\n \\n Kurt and Riela were featured in the Nintendo 3DS crossover Project X Zone , representing the Valkyria series . Media.Vision would return to the series to develop Valkyria : Azure Revolution , with Ozawa returning as director . Azure Revolution is a role @-@ playing video game for the PlayStation 4 that forms the beginning of a new series within the Valkyria franchise . \\n \\n = = = Adaptations = = = \\n \\n Valkyria Chronicles 3 was adapted into a two @-@ episode original video animation series in the same year of its release . Titled Senjō no Valkyria 3 : Taga Tame no xxunk ( xxunk xxunk , lit . Valkyria of the Battlefield 3 : The Wound Taken for Someone \\'s Sake ) , it was originally released through PlayStation Network and xxunk between April and May 2011 . The initially @-@ planned release and availability period needed to be extended due to a stoppage to PSN during the early summer of that year . It later released for DVD on June 29 and August 31 , 2011 , with separate \" Black \" and \" Blue \" editions being available for purchase . The anime is set during the latter half of Valkyria Chronicles III , detailing a mission by the Nameless against their Imperial rivals Calamity Raven . The anime was first announced in November 2010 . It was developed by A @-@ 1 Pictures , produced by Shinji xxunk , directed by Nobuhiro Kondō , and written by Hiroshi xxunk . Sakimoto \\'s music for the game was used in the anime . \\n The anime \\'s title was inspired by the principle purpose of the Nameless : to suffer in battle for the goals of others . A subtitle attached to the project during development was \" The Road to Kubinka \" , which referenced the Kubinka Tank Museum in Moscow . The game \\'s main theme was how the characters regained their sense of self when stripped of their names and identities , along with general themes focused on war and its consequences . While making the anime , the production team were told by Sega to make it as realistic as possible , with the consequence that the team did extensive research into aspects such as what happened when vehicles like tanks were overturned or damaged . Due to it being along the same timeline as the original game and its television anime adaptation , the cast of Valkyria Chronicles could make appearances , which pleased the team . The opening theme , \" Akari ( Light ) xxunk \" ( xxunk @-@ xxunk ) , was sung by Japanese singer xxunk . The ending theme , \" Someday the Flowers of Light Will Bloom \" ( xxunk , Itsuka Saku Hikari no Hana ) , was sung by Minami Kuribayashi . Both songs \\' lyrics were written by their respective artists . \\n Two manga adaptations were produced , following each of the game \\'s main female protagonists Imca and Riela . They were Senjō no Valkyria 3 : Namo xxunk xxunk no Hana ( 戦場のヴァルキュリア3 xxunk , lit . Valkyria of the Battlefield 3 : The Flower of the Nameless Oath ) , illustrated by Naoyuki Fujisawa and eventually released in two volumes after being serialized in Dengeki Maoh between 2011 and 2012 ; and Senjō no Valkyria 3 : xxunk Unmei no xxunk xxunk ( 戦場のヴァルキュリア3 xxunk , lit . Valkyria of the Battlefield 3 -The Valkyrie of the Crimson Fate ) , illustrated by Mizuki Tsuge and eventually released in a single volume by Kadokawa Shoten in 2012 . \\n \\n'"

       "' \\n = Luke Smith ( writer ) = \\n \\n Luke Michael Smith is an American writer . He is a staff member at Bungie , a video game development company , and is a former video games journalist . Smith wrote for a college newspaper and weekly papers in Michigan before being hired as one of the first new freelance writers for Kotaku . At Kotaku , Smith developed his writing style but soon left the site for a staff position as 1UP.com \\'s news editor . Smith made a name for himself at 1UP , particularly through an article he wrote focusing on problems with the game Halo 2 . \\n Smith was known for his direct approach to game journalism and scathing criticism of the video game industry . During his time at 1UP the site developed a greater profile and stepped out of its sister publication \\'s shadow , but Smith grew frustrated with the contemporary state of gaming news and what he considered manipulation of journalists and readers into accepting promotional material as news . In April 2007 he left 1UP to become a Bungie writer and co @-@ host of the developer \\'s podcast . \\n \\n = = Early career = = \\n \\n Smith gradually entered into game journalism while working on an English Literature degree at the University of Michigan , writing about media in the college newspaper . After graduation , he worked for weekly papers in Dearborn and Detroit , Michigan , including Real Detroit Weekly . \\n Clive Thompson , a games writer with Slate , interacted with Smith over AOL Instant Messenger and the two began to bounce ideas off of each other for their respective writing projects ; when games blog Kotaku started to expand from one writer ( founder Brian Crecente ) , Thompson recommended Smith . Smith credits his time at Kotaku for helping him come into his own , develop his style and learn about attribution and citing sources , but he left after a short period of time . \" At the time stories ( on Kotaku ) were unsigned . Kotaku was like the Brian Crecente vision . If I posted something or [ fellow writer Brian Ashcraft ] did people thought [ Crecente ] did . Also , there was no health insurance , it was just full @-@ time freelance . \" \\n \\n = = 1UP.com journalism = = \\n \\n Smith served as the news editor for 1UP.com , the sister site to the now @-@ defunct magazine Electronic Gaming Monthly . During his tenure at 1UP , Smith wrote extensively about the Halo video game franchise , as was considered a leading fan voice ; in one article , he declared Halo was the only game series he cared about . Smith wrote a feature story for 1UP in 2005 called \" Broken Halo \" , in which he explained how developer Bungie could fix problems he perceived with the game ; Crecente said the article put Smith \" on the map \" . Smith also became one of the panelists of the 1UP Yours show , a weekly video games podcast featuring gaming editors and experts . In 2006 , Edge named him one of gaming \\'s top 50 journalists . \\n xxunk magazine credited Smith with inspiring gamers to learn more about the game industry and not accept company promotion , as well as turning 1UP from \" the bastard child of EGM \" to an important part of the Ziff Davis Internet company \\'s gaming network . His style has been described as a \" robust , direct approach \" to journalism and is known for his scathing attacks on the industry . Smith , however , felt disheartened by the state of game journalism . \" Video game journalism is just weird . You have guys married to women in marketing for the games they cover . Video game journalism is still very young , very early , still trying to find out what it is , \" he said . In an interview with Michael Zenke of The Escapist , Smith said he felt game journalists were treated by developers as another part of the PR plan , with developers sending out information and the journalists \" regurgitating \" it . Worse , Smith felt that gamers had become used to this sort of information ; \" We have to be responsible for our actions and held accountable when we manipulate the expectations of gamers , \" he told Zenke . \\n While he was becoming more frustrated with the field at 1UP , game developer Bungie contacted Smith about employment . After sending the company his resume , Smith stopped writing about Bungie and Microsoft to avoid a conflict of interest . Smith accepted a job offer a month later . \\n \\n = = Bungie = = \\n \\n In April 2007 , Smith announced on a 1UP podcast he was leaving the site to work for Bungie . Reaction to Smith \\'s announcement varied ; some were happy or sad to see him leave , while others felt he had \" sold out . \" Smith joined the ranks of other former game journalists who left to work for game companies , including 1UP expatriate Che Chou , who joined Microsoft Game Studios , and former GameSpot chief Greg Kasavin , who became an associate producer for Electronic Arts . \\n Bungie staff hinted in a weekly update that Smith might play a role in the developer \\'s podcast . Smith officially began work on May 7 , 2007 , as content editor , providing fans and the Bungie readership with information about Bungie \\'s game and staff . Smith believed that there was a special opportunity for game developers , \" for someone to come in and tell the stories that people want to know [ ... ] Right now you have four bridges between developer and reader : Developer to PR , to journalist to reader . [ This position ] could get rid of those middle two bridges . \" \\n While Bungie had historically been good at letting fans interact via forums and provided updates and artwork via their site , Bungie.net , the company \\'s releases had a \" corporate and muted tone to it , \" and made less effort and been less successful historically at providing access to the inner workings of the game studio . As part of a change to become more transparent , Bungie took steps repeated throughout the industry to allow fans more say and recruiting respected voices from the community — namely , Smith . Robertson credited Smith \\'s tenure as aiding Bungie \\'s greater focus on , \" building , supporting and learning from the Halo 3 community . \" He is credited as a writer on Halo 3 . \\n Smith also hosted Bungie \\'s podcast show along with co @-@ host Brian Jarrard ; in an interview with his former coworkers at 1UP , Smith said of the Bungie podcast , \" we [ Bungie ] are focusing on getting our listeners and fans familiar with a bunch of the different faces at Bungie studios . \" Brought back after close to a year @-@ long hiatus , the podcast now features Bungie news and interviews with staff members about their jobs and working at the studio . Smith had the title of \" Bungie Community Manager \" at Bungie , and has given interviews with the press about the company \\'s recent products , including Halo 3 : ODST . Smith was among other writers @-@ turned @-@ game developers who held a discussion on the topic at the 2009 Game Developers Conference . Smith worked on player investment for Halo : Reach . \\n He worked as design lead on Bungie \\'s 2014 video game Destiny . \\n \\n'"

This is because our pre-trained RNN inputs layer weight matrix (which comes directly after the word embedding matrix) expects its inputs to be exactly as long as the quantity of words in the vocab that was used to pre-train the model."

    "Now what's going on with the tensor that's stored in the `PackedSequence()` object's `batch_sizes` attribute? The length of this tensor is `3,352`, which is the length of the longest text document in the batch, and therefore also the length of all (padded) mini-batches our dataloader will feed into the model at the first training iteration. Notice that the first several entries in `batch_sizes` are `64`, which is what we've chosen as our dataloader's batch size. However, as we go further on down, these numbers begin to descrease, eventually dropping to `1`.\n",

The first several entries are 64 because all 64 mini-batches contain text documents that are long enough such that they all have non-padding tokens at these relatively early positions. However, as we go on, at token positions of around 1,000, we begin to see that a few batches' documents have already concluded and that at this and all subsequent indices, these documents only contain padding tokens. The pattern continues, at by the time we've reached token indices near the end of the longest document, close to 3,352, there remains only one batch that has non-padding tokens. This is the batch that contains our longest text document."

    "#### Building the Classifier Head using Concat Pooling\n",
    "So now we're able to run our mini-batches through LSTM layers while keeping their padding tokens from interfering with the LSTMs' ability to learn the difference between positive and negative movie reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in order to pass the outputs of our model's LSTM layers onto its classifier head, we had to add empty weights for each padding token back onto the end of each batch's parameter weights. Concretely, this means that right after the LSTM layers, the weight matrix containing the parameter weights for all input document tokens across all 64 batches now contains 300 values of `0.0000` for each padding token in each batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "And as it currently stands, all these `0.0000` values are going to be passed through one or more fully connected layers and activations inside the model's classifier head. And if we don't do something to prevent it from happening, the padding token weights' presence will surely make it difficult for the classifier module to convert our LSTM output into accurate classifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The long and short of it is that we're going to need a way to get our model's classifier head to ignore the weight parameters that belong to padding tokens. And we're not going to be able to rely on the `PackedSequence()` class that we used to pass embedding layer outputs through our model's LSTM layers because it's not compatible with fully connected, linear layers (it's only [designed to work with RNN layers](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/_modules/torch/nn/utils/rnn.html)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Thankfully, there are tricks we can use to ignore padding inside our model's classifier head. In fact, there is one trick for each of the three elements that are used by a ULMFiT classifier head:\n",
    "1. The (dropped-out) output of the encoder's final LSTM layer for the final timestep.\n",
    "2. The max pool of the (dropped-out) output of the encoder's final LSTM layer, over as many timesteps as will fit inside GPU memory (ideally, all timesteps/every token in the document).\n",
    "3. The average pool of the (dropped-out) output of the encoder's final LSTM layer, over as many timesteps as will fit inside GPU memory (ideally, all timesteps/every token in the document).\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get to the tricks for ignoring padding, let's take a brief detour and try to understand why our classifier makes use of each of the above three elements: \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that most document classification models prior to ULMFiT had relied solely on `1.`, the final LSTM layer's outputs at the final timestep, for generating predictions. However, [as mentioned](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146) by Jeremy and Sebastian in their paper, the clues that are most helpful for classifying a real-world document can be found anywhere inside the document. When input documents consist of hundreds of words or more, this information may well be inadvertently ignored if we only look at the words whose weights are contained in the portion of the final LSTM layer's output that belongs to the final timestep (in other words, belongs to the final non-padding token from each document). This is the motivation that spurred Jeremy and Sylvain to *concatenate* final timestep information with both a max pooling and an average pooling of final LSTM layer outputs that cover as many timesteps as possible (ideally all non-padding timesteps/tokens in each document). The idea is, obviously, to allow our classifier to consider information from as broad a portion of a document as possible, before deciding on the most appropriate classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll shortly write a class called `PoolingLinearClassifier` that calculates this average and max pooling, concatenates it to the final LSTM layer's final timestep output, and then runs this entire tensor through a succession of several clusters of batchnorm/dropout/linear/ReLU layers. The output of these final layers is then passed through a softmax and loss will be calculated (or predictions will be returned, if the model is performing inference).\n",
    "\n",
    "First, however, we'll illustrate, mechanically-speaking, how concat pooling in the classifier head actually works. Just below is a class, `ConcatPooling`, that we'll use to concretely demonstrate just how we capture all three of the elements that we concatenate together at the beginning of the classifier head (so that we can pass them through its fully connected layers). \n",
    "\n",
    "In each case, you'll also be able to see how padding tokens are ignored. Designing the AWD_LSTM module to also return a mask that contains the locations of each padding token's weights will turn out to have been the most crucial trick."

    "#### Modulating how documents are fed into the AWD-LSTM encoder\n",
    "With our model's complete classifier head, `PoolingLinearClassifier` fully implemented, there's just one final potential problem that must be addressed before we're ready to actually begin training on IMDB movie reviews. If we take the complete documents handled by all 64 batches during a single training iteration and feed these full-sized documents into the AWD-LSTM encoder in one fell swoop, there's a real chance that we might run out of GPU memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now if the documents contained inside a text dataset are short enough, there is likely little chance of this happening. But what if our documents are several hundred, or even several thousand words in length? If you're still in a language model training mindset, you might suggest something like, \"why don't we just split up our really long documents across consecutive training iterations?\" After all, this is exactly what we did when training our language model.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this approach is completely untenable for training a document classifier. At the end of a single training iteration, we need to be able to run inference, make a prediction, and calculate loss for each one of the 64 batches' text documents. This won't be possible if we split batches' very long documents between two training iterations. Our goal is to classify complete documents, not halves of documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we need an approach that will allow us to run inference on batches containing documents of any length, no matter how long, at the end of each and every training iteration. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our solution will be to create a class that wraps our AWD-LSTM encoder module and steadily feeds identically-sized chunks of all 64 batches' documents into the AWD-LSTM encoder. As the AWD-LSTM module's LSTM layers do their work and generate outputs for each chunk, our wrapper will steadily aggregate all of these mini-outputs into the full-sized output tensors we'd normally expect our AWD-LSTM module to provide.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll call this wrapper class `DocumentEncoder`. Note that its input, the 64 batches that each contain one complete text document, is exactly the same input that we would have passed to an AWD-LSTM module. And the `DocumentEncoder` class' output, a tuple of LSTM layer outputs (both dropped-out and non-dropped-out) as well as a padding mask, is exactly the same as what the AWD-LSTM module would output. The document chunks that `DocumentEncoder` allows to trickle into the AWD-LSTM encoder will all be sized at a length of `bptt` tokens, which is 70 tokens in our example here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The end result will be as if we had fed our batches' text documents directly into AWD-LSTM encoder, itself. Because at the end of the day, the `DocumentEncoder` wrapper class doesn't add any new logic to how our AWD-LSTM encoder works. Rather, it just modulates the pace at which our AWD-LSTM encoder operates, so that we don't run the risk of triggering a CUDA out-of-memory error (which absolutely would happen if we ever have a had a training iteration where each batch contained documents sized at, say, 10 million words each).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to think of this whole process is that our `DocumentEncoder` wrapper class just splits each training iteration into a bunch of mini-iterations, and during each mini-iteration, the AWD-LSTM module encodes a small number of `bptt` (70, for us) tokens. The training iteration concludes once all these mini-iterations are done. And it is only at that point that predictions are generated, loss is calculated, and weight updates are performed."

We had used a batch size of 64 for training our classifier, and since our dataloader doubles the batchsize during inference, this would mean we'd have a batch size of 128 inputs for predictions if we leave things as they currently stand. This isn't a problem when performing inference simultaneously on several documents at once. However, part of our prediction task will be to demonstrate that the presence of padding doesn't throw off our model's predictive ability.\n",

And the only way to do this is to grab each document, remove its paddding and then perform inference, one-by-one. Doing this will rapidly fill up GPU memory and if we're not careful we'll easily hit an out-of-memory error."

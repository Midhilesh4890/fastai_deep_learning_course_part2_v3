# [Fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/2019/01/24/course-v3/) Deep Learning from the Foundations (Spring 2019)
*Part II of Fast.ai's two-part deep learning course, offered through [The Data Institute at USF](https://www.usfca.edu/data-institute). From March through April of 2019. Part I is [here](https://github.com/jamesdellinger/fastai_deep_learning_course_part1_v3).*

A bottom-up approach (through code, not math equations) to becoming a deep learning experimenter and expert practitioner. 

We implemented core fastai/PyTorch classes and modules from scratch, achieving similar or better performance. We also practiced implementing techniques presented in various papers, and spent significant time on strategies to decrease training time (parallelization, JIT).

The final two weeks were spent covering Swift for TensorFlow, where we

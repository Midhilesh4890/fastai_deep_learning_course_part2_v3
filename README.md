# [Fast.ai](https://www.usfca.edu/data-institute/certificates/deep-learning-part-two) Deep Learning from the Foundations (Spring 2019)
*Part II of Fast.ai's two-part deep learning course, offered through [The Data Institute at USF](https://www.usfca.edu/data-institute). From March through the end of April in 2019. Part I is [here](https://github.com/jamesdellinger/fastai_deep_learning_course_part1_v3).*

A bottom-up approach (through code, not math equations) to becoming an expert deep learning practitioner and experimenter. 

We implemented core [fastai](https://github.com/fastai/fastai) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html) classes and modules from scratch, achieving similar or better performance. We also practiced coding up techniques introduced in various papers, and then spent significant time on strategies useful in decreasing model training time (parallelization, JIT).

The final two weeks were spent diving deep into [Swift for TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/swift) with [Chris Lattner](http://www.nondot.org/sabre/), where we saw first-hand how [differentiable programming](https://medium.com/@karpathy/software-2-0-a64152b37c35) could work, and experienced the joy of coding deep learning models in a language that actually gets sent directly to the compiler.

All in all, I came away with both the know-how to engineer cutting-edge deep learning ideas from scratch with optimized code, as well as the expertise necessary to research and explore new ideas of my own.
